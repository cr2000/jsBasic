Homework 3:

Write a function, that will take 4 parameters:
- totalMoneyInATM
- enteredAmount
- usersDailyLimit
- PIN

Inside the function, check if the user has entered his proper PIN number (1234 is the correct combination).
Then calculate if the users input (enteredAmount), is larger than totalMoneyInATM. If not, continue, if yes, show an alert that "ATM doesn't have enough funds".
Then calculate if the users input (enteredAmount), is larger than the user's daily limit. If not, continue, if yes, show alert "Daily limit reached".
If all checks passed, show the user: "You have successfully taken out $AMOUNT1, and you have $AMOUNT2 left."

Hint:
$AMOUNT1 is the user's input
$AMOUNT2 is the difference between usersDailyLimit and enteredAmount
